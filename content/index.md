Hybrid Modularity : Balance in Standardization and Customization

Traditional modularization​​, implemented through ​​Offsite Fabrication + Onsite Integration​​, which prioritizes physical-layer. In practice, constrained by the ​​process specificity​​ of process industries, ​​diversity of specialized equipment​​, ​​complexity of construction site conditions​​, and ​​transportation limitations​​, traditional modular approaches often stall at the feasibility stage. Or ttempts to "forcibly implement" incur high risks and uncertainties due to compromised engineering integrity.

​​Hybrid Modularity​​ aims to optimize this paradigm by ​​enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness through standardized modules​​, while ​​preserving adaptability via customized modules/skids/process units​​. By implementing ​​unified interface spanning both physical and cyber-physical layers, it ​​organically integrates standardized and bespoke components​​, thereby resolving the ​​high-risk rigidity of full-customization​​ and the ​​inflexibility of standardization​​. Its essence lies in: ​​"Decoupling complexity through modularization, accommodating diverse demands via hybrid integration"​​.


Core Concept
​​Functional Encapsulation​​
Encapsulate specific process functions by decoupling modules based on process, hiding internal details while connecting and interacting externally via standardized interfaces.

Interface Standardization
Establish uniform interfaces at both physical connection layers and control-communication layers, standardizing connection methods to reduce costs and enhance adaptability.

​​Plug-and-Play (PnP) Integration​​
Combine hybrid modules through plug-and-play mechanisms to achieve complete process flows.

​​High Extensibility​​
Enable scalable system expansion via unified interfaces, reducing maintenance and process upgrade costs.
